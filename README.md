# QA-Assessment-Project
Cocktail Library

PROJECT BRIEF

Design and build a cocktail recipe application, using MySQL to house the relevant data. It must be possible to add new cocktails, or amend, or delete, existing entries, to the library after deployment. Users must be able to search for a specific cocktail and return the relevant recipe, or search for a specific ingredient and return a list of relevant cocktails.

RETROSPECTIVE COMMENTS

Diversions from project brief:
The original assessment project brief required the application to be hosted in the cloud using Docker Swarm and to use Jenkins to create a CI/CD pipeline to automate the testing, integration and deployment of new code. However, although Jenkins was introduced, these aspects were not covered during the course.

What went well:
- starting to understand HTML.
- developing a mental checklist for connection errors.
- more able to interpret errors printed in terminal.

What didn't go well:
- Extensive time lost to looking for errors and trying to solve them.
- Extensive time lost due to increased frequency of migraines (most likely caused by over-excessive screentime).
- Failed an Agile principle by spending too much time playing around with cosmetics rather than functionality (partly because I enjoy the design aspect; partly because I was getting stressed and frustrated with the functionailty issues).
- Have realised that I do not have enough knowledge, or understanding of knowledge recently gained, to complete my own project goals. I thought I had some understanding, as things generally made sense when following the tutor. However, when it came to putting it all together myself, it became obvious that I have not yet retained enough knowledge, or yet gained enough understanding, to fully realise this project.

What would I change:
- Remember not to get hung-up on aesthetics and complete functionality first.
- Keep it simple and within the bounds of existing knowledge.
- Gain a higher level of understanding of all aspects before starting.
- Start working towards project with a modular approach from the beginning of the course, rather than trying to do it all at towards the end. 
- Make more effort to obtain a recommended reading list. I did ask for one before the course began and I regret not asking again after the course started. Some of the tutors did share pdfs and recommend alternative online resources to the class, but a few paper reference books would have helped to reduce screentime and migraines. I'm also someone who retains knowledge better and faster through reading than through lectures and I feel that this would have helped to cement my understanding.
