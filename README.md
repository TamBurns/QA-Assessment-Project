# QA-Assessment-Project
Cocktail Library

PROJECT BRIEF

Design and build a cocktail library application, using MySQL to house the relevant data. It must be possible to add new cocktails, or amend existing entries, to the library after deployment. Users must be able to search for a specific cocktail and return the relevant recipe, or search for a specific ingredient and return a list of relevant cocktails. It should be possible to delete an entry if required.
The library is to be hosted in the cloud in a Docker Swarm and will use Jenkins to automate the CI/CD pipeline.
