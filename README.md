# QA-Assessment-Project
Cocktail Library

PROJECT BRIEF

Design and build a cocktail library application, using MySQL to house the relevant data. It must be possible to add new cocktails, or amend, or delete, existing entries, to the library after deployment. Users must be able to search for a specific cocktail and return the relevant recipe, or search for a specific ingredient and return a list of relevant cocktails.

RETROSPECTIVE COMMENTS
Diversions from project brief:
The original project brief required the application to be hosted in the cloud using Docker Swarm and to use Jenkins to create a CI/CD pipeline to automate the integration and deployment of new code. However, although Jenkins was introduced, neither of these aspects were covered during the course.

What went well:
- starting to understand HTML

What didn't go well:
- extensive time lost to looking for errors and trying to solve them.
- extensive time lost due to increased frequency of migraines (most likely caused by over-excessive screentime).
- failed an Agile principle by spending too much time playing around with cosmetics rather than functionality (partly because I enjoy the design aspect; partly because I was getting stressed and frustrated with the functionailty issues)
